Test tags allow to influence the execution condition of the given test configuration, or to define a required condition for
passing or failing the test. These expressions are simply placed in the configuration file of the corresponding tests, a tag
at the beginning of the line indicates which test tag the line corresponds to. The following tags are available:

* **Passing a test**:
  The expression marked with the tag `#PASS` has to be found in the output in order for the test to pass. If the expression
  is not found, the test fails.

* **Failing a test**:
  If the expression tagged with `#FAIL` is found in the output, the test fails. If the expression is not found, the test
  passes.

* **Depending on another test**:
  The tag `#DEPENDS` can be used to indicate dependencies between tests. For example, module test
  `ROOTObjectReader/01-reading` implements such a dependency as it uses the output of module test
  `ROOTObjectWriter/01-write` to read data from a previously produced Allpix Squared data file.

* **Defining a timeout**:
  For performance tests the runtime of the application is monitored, and the test fails if it exceeds the number of seconds
  defined using the `#TIMEOUT` tag.

* **Adding additional CLI options**:
  Additional module command line options can be specified for the `allpix` executable using the `#OPTION` tag, following
  the format found in [Section 3.5](../03_getting_started/05_allpix_executable.md). The `-o` flag will be added
  automatically. Multiple options can be supplied by repeating the `#OPTION` tag in the configuration file, only one option
  per tag is allowed. In exactly the same way options for the detectors can be set as well using the `#DETOPION` tag, where
  `-g` will be added automatically. For all other command line options to be passed to the executable, the `#CLIOPTION` can
  be used. Here, the complete flag and possible value needs to be passed, e.g. `-j9`.

* **Defining a test case label**:
  Tests can be grouped and executed based on labels, e.g. for code coverage reports. Labels can be assigned to individual
  tests using the `#LABEL` tag.

* **Describing the test**:
  Every test should bear a short description of its goal. This descriptive text can be provided via the `#DESC` tag and is
  required for every test. CMake will print warnings for every test missing this tag.

* **Running scripts**:
  Some tests require additional input which needs to be generated by a script. For this propose, commands to be executed
  *before* the tests starts can be provided via the `#BEFORE_SCRIPT` tag, e.g.

  ```shell
  #BEFORE_SCRIPT python @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/etc/scripts/create_deposition_file.py --type a --detector mydetector --events 2 --steps 1 --seed 0
  ```

  to run a Python script that generates an input file read by the test.

* **Requiring external data**:
  Some tests require external data which needs to be downloaded before executing the test. For this purpose, the `#DATA`
  tag is available, which can contain file paths which will be set as required files for the test. If registered with
  CMake's ExternalData module, they will be downloaded automatically.
