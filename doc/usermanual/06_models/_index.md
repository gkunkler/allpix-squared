Allpix Squared implements a variety of properties and models to describe the physics of semiconductor detectors. Models are
implemented module-independently and can be selected via configuration parameters in the respective models, while sensor
material properties serve as a default to module parameters and can be overwritten in the respective configuration section.
This chapter serves as central reference for the different properties and models.
