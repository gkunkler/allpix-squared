     * @note This module supports multithreading
     *
     * This module calculates the total induced charge by a charge carrier via the Shockley-Ramo theorem by comparing the
     * weighting potential at the initial and final position. The initial position is retrieved via the DepositedCharge
     * object in the history. The total induced charge is calculated per pixel and published as PixelCharge object.
     *
     * This module requires a weighting potential and only works properly of both electrons and holes are present among the
     * propagated charge carriers.
