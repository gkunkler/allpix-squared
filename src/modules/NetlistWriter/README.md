## Description

Integrates micro-electronics simulation elements in the Allpix Squared simulation flow. Allows the user to generate netlists (input file used by an electrical simulator to simulate the behavior of the circuit) from a given netlist template. `SPECTRE` (Cadence environment) and `SPICE` syntax are allowed and can be selected using the `target` parameter. This module is mostly intended for analog front-end electrical simulation using the `PixelCharge` object data.

The netlist template needs to be formatted as described and illustrated (`SPECTRE` syntax) below:

* The netlist header.
* A sub-circuit describing the circuit of interest (analog front-end for example).
* If necessary, other instances (for example other voltage or current sources of the front-end).
* A current source, which will be used to replicate the electrical behavior of the collection electrode. A particular attention should be given to the polarity of the source.
* The sub-circuit written as an instance, connected to the source.
* The netlist footer and the simulator options.

```ini

```

One way to get a netlist already formatted could be to extract it from the Cadence Virtuoso environment ("schematic" view).

A new netlist is written for each event, reusing the header, footer, and circuit description from the netlist template specified with the `netlist_template` parameter. For each fired pixel, a source / circuit instance pair is added to the template.

The new source written can be parameterized with the parameter `source_type`. Two different types of sources can be used: `ISOURCE_PWL` and `ISOURCE_PULSE`:

* `ISOURCE_PWL` allows writing all the temporal current waveform using a PWL (Piecewise Linear). This requires the use of the `[PulseTransfer]` module to get the current waveform. A delay can also be added using `t_delay`
* In order to lightweight the generated netlists, the `ISOURCE_PULSE` can be selected: it uses the total collected charge Q (instead of the current pulse). Charge and current are linked by $ Q = \int I(t)dt $. The current pulse is set with the parameters `t_delay`, `t_rise`, `t_width` and `t_fall`. The following equation is then used to determine the current: $ I=\frac{Q}{\frac{t_{rise}+t_{fall}}{2}+t_{width}} $

The generated netlist file name can be configured with a prefix taken from the `file_name` parameter, and contains the number of the event the netlist was generated for. The file extension is taken from the input netlist template file.

The pixel address is used to identify the fired pixels in the netlist, a linearization following

```math
i = x * N_y + y
```

is used. Here, `x` and `y` are the respective pixel coordinates and $`N_y`$ is the number of pixels along `y`.
This means that e.g. considering pixel (6,3) fired (7th column and 4th row) in a 10x10 matrix, the index 63 will be written in the netlist for this pixel..

The parameter `waveform_to_save` is used to write at the end of the generated netlist the waveform(s) to be saved (always using the index notation to identify the fired pixels).
The electrical circuit simulation can be performed within the Allpix Squared event using the parameter `simulator_command` which is used to specify the command line to execute. Not setting it switches the feature off, setting a value will enable it. The generated netlist name to execute is appended at the end of the command, as illustrated below for `SPECTRE` syntax:

```shell
spectre -f nutascii <file_name_event1.scs>
```

If performed, the electrical simulation puts in stand-by the execution of the event. This electrical simulation is performed in the same terminal as the Allpix event, thus requiring the electrical simulator environment to be correctly set.


## Parameters

* `target`: Syntax for the additional data to be written in the netlist, either `SPECTRE` or `SPICE`.
* `netlist_template`: Location of file containing the netlist template of the circuit in one of the supported formats.
* `file_name` : Generated netlist prefix name to which the event number is added as suffix. Defaults to `output_netlist_event_`.
* `source_type`: Type of current source to be used, `ISOURCE_PWL` and `ISOURCE_PULSE`.
* `source_name`: Name of the current source instance in the netlist.
* `subckt_name`: Name of the circuit the source is connected to.
* `common_nets`: Nets shared between the pixels.
* `t_delay`: delay from 0 before the current pulse starts, defaults to 0 ns
* `t_rise`: rise time of the current pulse, defaults to 1 ns, only works for the `ISOURCE_PULSE`
* `t_width`: width of the current pulse, defaults to 3 ns, only works for the `ISOURCE_PULSE`
* `t_fall`: fall time of the current pulse, defaults to 1 ns, only works for the `ISOURCE_PULSE`
* `waveform_to_save`: Name of the waveforms to save
* `simulator_command`: If specified, launches the electrical simulation. Command to be executed in the terminal, the generated netlist name is appended at the end of the command.


## Usage

A possible configuration is using a `ISOURCE_PWL` and the `SPICE` syntax, requiring the collecting electrode capacitance:

```ini
[NetlistWriter]
target = SPICE
netlist_template = "front_end.asc"
source_type = ISOURCE_PWL
source_name = Instance_source
subckt_name = Instance_front_end
common_nets = Comp_vref, SUB, VDDA, VSSA, Vfbk
waveform_to_save = Pix_in, CSA_out, Comp_vout
simulator_command = "wine 'your\path\LTSpiceXVII\XVIIx64.exe' -run"
```

A current pulse `ISOURCE_PULSE` and the `SPECTRE` syntax is used is this example:

```ini
[NetlistWriter]
target = SPECTRE
netlist_template = "front_end.scs"
source_type = ISOURCE_PULSE
t_delay = 200ns
t_rise = 5ns
t_width = 20ns
t_fall = 5ns
source_name = Instance_source
subckt_name = Instance_front_end
common_nets = Comp_vref, SUB, VDDA, VSSA, Vfbk
waveform_to_save = Comp_vout
simulator_command = "spectre +aps -warn -info -log -debug -f nutascii"
```
