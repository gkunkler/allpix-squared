     * the range of x, value of y and the binning has to be provided. The exact value of pow(x, y) is calculated for each
     * of the bin boundaries. After construction, the result of x^y can be obtained for every value of x within the defined
     * range using linear interpolation between neighboring bins.
     *
     * By not clamping the input value x to the pre-calculated range, but only the derived table bins, values at positions
     * outside the defined range are extrapolated linearly from the first and last bin.
